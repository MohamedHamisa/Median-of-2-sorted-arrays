# Median-of-2-sorted-arrays

One of the common questions in interviews how to get the median when you get 2 arrays so you need to merge and sort them and know the length to get if it's even or odd so you can get the median
Another approach you can pop the items from front and end so the remaining is the median eiter it was even array or odd array.
